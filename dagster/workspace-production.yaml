# Dagster Workspace Configuration for Production
#
# This file defines the code locations that Dagster will load in production.
# It points to both fallback DAGs (built into the container) and dynamically
# synced DAGs from S3 storage.
#
# Note: This file is used as a fallback when S3 sync is disabled or fails.
# In normal operation, the entrypoint script downloads an updated workspace.yaml
# from S3 that may contain additional or different code locations.
