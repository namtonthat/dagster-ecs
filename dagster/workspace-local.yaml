#
# This file defines the code locations that Dagster will load in local development.
# It points to the local DAG files for development and testing.
#
# Note: In local development, this file is mounted directly from the filesystem.
# In production, the workspace.yaml is synced from S3 and may contain different
# or additional code locations.
